<!--
MEMORY.md is an INDEX, not a content store. It loads into context every session,
so keep it lean — aim for < 200 lines.
  • One line per memory: `- [Title](path) — short hook` (≤ 200 chars).
  • The detail lives in the linked topic file, NOT here. Never paste a summary in.
  • Group entries under a few category headers — do NOT add a `##` section per memory.
  • Do NOT index spec/, report/, research/, or project/ memories — those are browsed
    with list_memories(topic="…"), never listed here.
The write_memory hook warns when these are violated; trim on the warning.

## Response & Style

- [Response Format](feedback/FEEDBACK_RESPONSE_FORMAT.md) — no conversational language, use functional/direct phrasing only
- [Read docs = list memories](feedback/FEEDBACK_READ_DOCS_MEANS_LIST.md) — "read the docs" means check MEMORY.md and use Serena to list_memories, not external docs
- [Commit prefixes](feedback/FEEDBACK_COMMIT_PREFIXES.md) — `<type>: <change> (vX.Y.Z)`; never "Bump version to …" subjects

## Features

- [Feature Index](index/INDEX_FEATURES.md) — Feature registry with relationships and types

## Architecture

## Workflow Routing

| Situation                | Go To                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Simple lookup ("find X") | `WF_RESEARCH`             |
| Starting work (full)     | `WF_INIT` → `WF_CLASSIFY` |
| Researching              | `WF_RESEARCH`             |
| Making changes           | `WF_CLASSIFY`             |
| Continuing               | `WF_CONTINUE`             |
| Verifying                | `WF_VERIFY`               |
